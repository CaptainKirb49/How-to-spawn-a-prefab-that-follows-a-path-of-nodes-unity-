# How-to-spawn-a-prefab-that-follows-a-path-of-nodes-unity-
Hello, I am trying to create a tower defense game and everything has worked smoothly so far except for the fact that I can't Destroy the enemy as it hits the death zone causing more than one damage to take place. Also it boggs down the system that I am using because of the high amounts of GameObjects. I am trying to find a solution that involves making the enemy a prefab that I can just instantiate. However I have tried many different things and most of the time it just breaks the game. I have my code attached as well as the editor view. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!
